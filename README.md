# Clinical Data Dashboard – Patient Insights & Analysis

A professional clinical data dashboard designed to analyze patient demographics, contact types, age-group distribution, and key health service utilization metrics.  
This project demonstrates my ability to organize clinical datasets, build interactive dashboards, and extract meaningful insights for healthcare decision-making.

## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard provides a comprehensive snapshot of patient activities across different clinical service areas.  
It highlights:

- Total patient interactions
- Gender distribution
- Age group segmentation
- Contact type analysis
- Health board distribution
- Length of care insights

The goal is to support healthcare teams with a visual, data-driven tool that simplifies performance tracking and resource planning.

## 🔍 Insights & Findings (Using Real Values)

### *1. Total Patients*  
- The dataset contains *333 patient records*.

### *2. Gender Distribution*  
- *Female:* 190 patients (*57%*)  
- *Male:* 143 patients (*43%*)  
Women account for the majority of patient interactions.

### *3. Age Group Breakdown*  
The most common age group is *25–64 years, with **168 patients (50.4%)*.

Other groups include:  
- *65–74 years:* 93 patients  
- *75–84 years:* 62 patients  
- *85+ years:* 10 patients  

This shows that the clinical service primarily serves *middle-aged and older adults*.

### *4. Contact Professional Activities*  
- A total of *202 interactions* were recorded with clinical professionals.

### *Overall Insight*  
Patient engagement is strongest among middle-aged and older adults, with more female patients accessing services.  
The high volume of professional contact activity indicates strong patient-clinician engagement within the care system.
